# Fintrox Session Handoff — 2026-10-11

## Current milestone
ENTITIES-EXPANSION — ServiceManagement: 25 module models, 815 overall. Next SubscriptionBilling.


## Changes
180 new domain entity classes across all 36 modules, 36 module-local identity/tenant bases and validation helpers, typed enums, executable invariant tests, machine-readable inventory and CI completeness check. Full list: MODULE_STATUS.md / architecture/domain-entities.json.
Existing 32 legacy entity/persistence types, financial runtime behavior and migrations preserved. No extra projects or cross-module references.

## Validation
Local affected-graph Release build and 604 tests passed; 5 PostgreSQL tests skipped locally. Architecture and inventory checks passed. CI verification pending; see VALIDATION.md. Previously verified AUTH-002: 422cc38, CI 38012762635, 51/51 tests and migration gates passed.

## Scope
Entity foundation only. New types are not yet EF tables, services, DTOs, endpoints or frontend screens. Domain constructor validation is not tenant authorization or reference existence validation. No complete ERP module claimed.

## Next exact action
Expand SubscriptionBilling Domain records with immutable validated fields; update MODULE_STATUS.md, module README, machine inventory and ENTITY_EXPANSION_LOG.md in the same commit.
