# Audit

Status: structural skeleton only; no registered services, endpoints, tables or business rules.

Owns: AuditTrail, AccessHistory, Export.
Reserved PostgreSQL schema: `audit` (not created).
Existing implementation/reference: Audit; transaction-local auditing requires migration.

## Boundaries

- Domain: pure model, value objects, invariants and internal domain events.
- Application: feature-oriented use cases; ports in Abstractions. Commands/queries belong under their feature when implemented.
- Contracts: versioned DTOs and integration events; no entities, EF, ASP.NET or implementation dependencies.
- Infrastructure: module-owned context, configurations, migrations, messaging and external adapters.
- Presentation: thin HTTP endpoints and transport mapping; no persistence access.
- Composition: the host explicitly wires Infrastructure and Presentation when implementation is authorized.

Foreign data is referenced by identifiers/snapshots and accessed through approved Contracts.
No cross-module DbContext, repositories, entity navigations, SQL joins, foreign keys or shared transactions in the target architecture.
See [architecture](../../../docs/architecture.md) for the current legacy exceptions and migration gates.
